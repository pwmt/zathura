zathura - a document viewer
===========================
zathura is a highly customizable and functional document viewer based on the
girara user interface library and several document libraries.

Requirements
------------
gtk3 (>= 3.6)
glib (>= 2.50)
girara (>= 0.2.7)
sqlite3 (optional, >= 3.5.9)
check (for tests)
intltool
libmagic from file(1) (optional, for mime-type detection)
libsynctex from TeXLive (optional, for SyncTeX support)
Sphinx (optional, for manpages and HTML documentation)
doxygen (optional, for HTML documentation)
breathe (optional, for HTML documentation)
sphinx_rtd_theme (optional, for HTML documentation)

Please note that you need to have a working pkg-config installation and that the
Makefile is only compatible with GNU make. If you don't have a working
pkg-config installation please set the GTK_INC, GTK_LIB, GIRARA_INC, GIRARA_LIB,
SQLITE_INC and SQLITE_LIB variables accordingly.

Also note that Sphinx is needed to build the manpages.  If it is not
installed, the man pages won't be built. For the HTML documentation, doxygen,
breathe and sphinx_rtd_theme are needed in addition to Sphinx.

If you don't want to build with support for sqlite databases, you can set
WITH_SQLITE=0 and sqlite support won't be available.

The use of magic to detect mime types is optional and can be disabled by setting
WITH_MAGIC=0.

If you pass these flags as a command line argument to make, you have to ensure
to pass the same flags when executing the install target.

If you want to build zathura's documentation, please install all python
dependencies from the ./doc/requirements.txt file.
