Both synctex forward and backwards synchronization are supported by zathura, To
enable synctex forward synchronization, please look at the *--synctex-forward*
and *--synctex-editor* options. zathura will also emit a signal via the D-Bus
interface. To support synctex backwards synchronization, zathura provides a
D-Bus interface that can be called by the editor. For convince zathura also
knows how to parse the output of the *synctex view* command. It is enough to
pass the arguments to *synctex view*'s *-i* option to zathura via
*--syntex-forward* and zathura will pass the information to the correct
instance.

Some editors support zathura as viewer out of the box:

* LaTeXTools for SublimeText
