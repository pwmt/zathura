Both synctex forward and backwards synchronization are supported by zathura, To
enable synctex forward synchronization, please look at the *--syntex* and
*--synctex-editor* options. To support synctex backwards synchronization,
zathura provides a D-Bus interface that can be called by the editor. For
convince zathura also knows how to parse the output of the *synctex view*
command. It is enough to pass the arguments to *synctex view*'s *-i* option to
zathura via *--syntex-forward* and zathura will pass the information to the
correct instance.
